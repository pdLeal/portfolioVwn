Each technology/language is its own game, with unique characteristics, nuances, and mechanics that must be mastered. Each project is like a level with its own challenges, obstacles to overcome (bosses), and surprises (easter eggs) to discover along the way. For me, coding is about having fun, learning, practicing, growing, evolving—and, finally, the thrill of beating that goddamn Souls boss you've been struggling with for the past 6 months.",
