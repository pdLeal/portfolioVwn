Each technology/language is its own genre, with unique characteristics, nuances, and mechanics that must be mastered.

For me, coding is about having fun, learning, practicing, growing, evolvingâ€”and, finally, the thrill of beating that goddamn Sekiro boss you've been struggling with for the past 6 months.</S.HiddenPara>}
